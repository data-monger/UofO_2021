# The Truth is Out There

In this module, students will build a dynamic table using JavaScript and incorporate it into a web site using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

## Purpose
To create dynamic content for an end user; To provide an end user with the ability to search and filter an existing data set.

## Results
See:

Filter Fields:
    Enter Date
    Enter City
    Enter State
    Enter Country
    Enter Shape

Input a value in the filter field
Click enter

Results will update automatically.


## Summary
A draw back with this method, is the end user is unable to view the entire data set- nor do they know valid parameters to enter in the filter fields.

A drop down menu in each filter parameter would address this, and an option to export the data would also provide access to the entire data set.
