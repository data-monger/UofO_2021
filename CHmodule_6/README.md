# Module 6 | Assignment - WeatherPy

Plot the relationship between latitude and weather parameters for more than 500 cities around the world using Python, Pandas, and the OpenWeatherMap and Google APIs.

## Weather DataBase

Using a random number generator, creates paired latitude and longitudes from which to join to a cities db.
Then collects weather data for these paired lat/long cities.

## Vacation Search 

From the above data, collects hotels within each city based on the paired coordinates and user's max and min temperature conditions.

## Itinerary

From the hotel locations found in Vacation Search, use the plotted locations to plan a vacation and create an itinerary. Input the cities (not yet setup to be user-input) and plot the travel course. Use the pop-ups to help decision making.
