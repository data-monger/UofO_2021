## Overview
We've done a weather analysis using weather data from weather stations around the Hawai'i Island to determine the viability and predict the success of an Ice Cream shop.

## Results
The analysis provides the following:

* Daily Temperatures for the month of June
* Daily Temperatures for the month of Dec
* Daily Temperatures for all the available Jun months (not displayed)
* Daily Temperatures for all the available Dec months (not displayed)
* A breakdown analysis of the Jun temperatures
* A breakdown analysis of the Dec temperatures
* A breakdown analysis of all the available Jun temperatures (not displayed)
* A breakdown analysis of all the available Dec temperatures (not displayed)

The variance between the single Jun/Dec month and the average of all the Jun/Dec months will give us an opportunity to determine potential fluctuation for any anomalies that may not be captured within a single month/year time frame- using all the months available to us will provide us with a significantly more robust model for decision making.

## Summary

Temperature fluctuations between the two extreme months (summer and winter) are minimal.
Two additional query which could be run, which would check for precipitation for the 2 months in question; We could duplicate our process above- gaining insight into an overall average, vs a single month view to assist us in projecting for any outliers.
Though additional market research should be done to determine the effect of precipitation on the residents willingness to leave their homes and participate in outdoor activities.
